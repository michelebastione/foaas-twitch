# FOAAS for Twitch
This bot, coded using the twitchio library to work on the Twitch platform, is designed to do 3 things: tell random jokes, give the definition of a word according to Urban Dictionary and ehm ehm tell peope to fuck off in creative ways (I added this one inspired by the [namesake project](https://github.com/tomdionysus/foaas) by tomdyonisus); but it is so simple it really can be adapted to do any kind of task. Fill the .env file with the info from your twitch bot account of choice and you'll be good to go. My working version can be found at [https://www.twitch.tv/bot_for_giggles](https://www.twitch.tv/bot_for_giggles).
